# Autonomous-Agents
This project utilizes genetic algorithms (supervised learning) in the field of Artificial Intelligence in order to create a game which contains autonomous agents. In the program, the autonomous agents (UFOs) slowly learn to pass through a meteor field with each passing "generation" through optimization of genetic algorithms. Programmed in Java with graphics provided by the Processing IDE.
